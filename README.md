Chinese (and Japanese) Text Conversion (A Calibre ebook editor plugin)
============

Currently, the Chinese language is written with two different standardized character sets. The Chinese mainland and Singapore officially use the simplified set while other areas (such as Taiwan and Hong Kong) continue to largely use the traditional set. This Calibre ebook editor plugin will allow users to convert between both formats.

It also can make changes to quotation mark formats and text flow direction. This
useful when dealing with Japanese ebooks.
